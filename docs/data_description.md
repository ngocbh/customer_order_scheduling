## Data Description

## The first line contains 3 integers, respectively, N, P, M

## In the next M lines, the line m (1 <= m <= M), contains p integers (1 <= p <= P) representing the value of S(m, p)

## In the next N lines, the line n (1 <= n <= N), contains p integers (1 <= p <= P) representing the value of D(n, p)

## In the next m * P lines, the line (m-1) * P + p (1 <= m <= M, 1 <= p <= P), contains n integers (1 <= n <= N) representing the value of c(m, p, n)
